# Data Structures and Algorithms In Java

## About
A collection of common data structures and algorithms implemented in Java by me. 

## Types Included:

### 1. Linear Data Structures
- **Lists**:
  - Array List
  - Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Circular Linked List
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
  - Variants: Circular Queue, Priority Queue

### 2. Hierarchical Data Structures
- **Trees**:
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
- **Heap**:
  - Min Heap/Max Heap
  - Priority Heap

### 3. Graphs
- **Undirected Graph**:
  - Adjacency Matrix/Adjacency List Implementations
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm

### 4. Hashing
- **Hash Table**
- **Hash Map**
- **Hash Set**

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-structures-java
   ```
3. Compile and run the individual data structure implementations using your preferred Java IDE or via the command line:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```

## Organization
Each data structure is located in its own folder, containing:
- Source Code (`.java` file): The implementation of the data structure.
- Test Cases: Examples and test cases demonstrating its usage.
- Documentation: Brief explanations of the structure, its time complexity, and common operations.

## Features
- Comprehensive coverage of common data structures.
- Self-contained implementations with minimal dependencies.
- Includes well-documented test cases to demonstrate correctness and usage.

## Future Plans
- Add more advanced data structures, such as Red-Black Trees, B-Trees, and Trie.
- Provide performance benchmarks for different operations.
- Include detailed explanations of algorithms and usage scenarios.
